Smart Video Summarizer and Auto-Cut Tool
📄 Project Description
This is a C++ based Smart Video Summarizer that automatically trims and summarizes long videos by detecting and removing low-importance segments. It uses motion detection, audio analysis (silence and loudness), and facial emotion detection to select the most meaningful parts of the video.

🚀 Features
Scene segmentation using optical flow and color histograms

Audio-based trimming using silence and loudness analysis via FFmpeg

Facial emotion-based scene scoring using OpenCV

Automatic clip extraction and video summary generation

YouTube video downloading and local video support

Fast processing using C++ and multi-threading

🛠️ Tech Stack
C++

OpenCV (Video Processing, Optical Flow, Face Detection)

FFmpeg (Audio Analysis, Video Trimming)

yt-dlp (YouTube Downloading)

📂 Installation
Install OpenCV

Install FFmpeg and add it to your system path

Install yt-dlp for YouTube downloads

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install yt-dlp
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartVideoSummarizer.git
💻 Usage
Run the program and provide either a local video path or a YouTube link when prompted.

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -std=c++17 your_main_file.cpp -o summarizer `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
./summarizer
📊 Output
Automatically generated summarized video (summary_video.mp4)

Temporary logs and clips will be cleaned automatically.

📌 Notes
Works best with lecture, tutorial, or long event videos.

Designed for offline summarization, real-time processing not yet supported.

🔮 Future Work
Integration of speech-to-text for more intelligent summarization

Real-time summarization for live video feeds

Deep learning-based scene scoring
